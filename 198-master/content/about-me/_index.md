My name is Felix and I am a game developer at Davis. I make games that I think other people would enjoy, but I also make games that I would enjoy playing myself as a video game enthusiast.  I hope to share my love of video games through the production of my own video games and animations to give others the chance to enjoy experiences that they might never get to play through. I love powerful visual effects, such as flashy VFX effects or highly stylized visual themes. In short, I am just a guy who likes video games, explosions, and sharing my appreciation of both.
