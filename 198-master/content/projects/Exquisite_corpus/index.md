This game is part of a larger game compiled from the work of other fellow game developers. The main game is a branching choose-your-own-adventure type of game in which the smaller games inhabit. Each developerâ€™s contribution to the game connects to the parts of two or more other developers. This particular contribution is one of the two scenes in which the player can begin and end their story in. This contribution to the game is essentially about a silent adventurer in pursuit of an extra-dimensional evil figure and utilizes a simple combat system along with some odd choice-based narrative.
