This was the first game I ever created with a team of people. I prototyped the concept and was the primary scripter of the team. The game was created in the Processing engine using Javascript. My inspiration from this game came from the various simulator games I have played in the past, such as the many “Sand” simulator flash games out there. Some inspiration also came from the orange tree from the front yard of my childhood home. I would often look out my window to take a break from the screen and admire the cluster of oranges growing on the tree as time went on over the years.
