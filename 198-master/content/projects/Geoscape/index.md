This is a procedurally generated landscape made of simple, non-round shapes. The particle effects that make the tree foliage and grass prevent the scene from appearing too still. This project reflects a personal love of the sterile, geometric aesthetic of early perceptions of virtual reality. The project explores the capabilities of the particle system of the Unity game engine.
